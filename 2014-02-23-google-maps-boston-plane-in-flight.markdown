<!-- Since my blog is hosted as example.com/blog/ and images are under example.com/images/, and 
since (my version of) Octopress converts a leading slash into /blog, following is the site-agnostic
way of getting to the images.

IOW, /../images/abc.png will be converted to /blog/../images/abc.png -->

I'm not sure if I'm the first one to spot this, but I just found a plane captured in-flight by [Google Maps][GoogleMapsLink]
